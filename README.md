The objective of the study is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in  order to get meaningful insights from it. Ease My Trip is an internet platform for booking flight tickets. Study of the data will lead to the discovery of valuable insights like there are different factors that affect the price of a flight, which would reduce the travel cost for the customer.

The “Random Forest Regressor” algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict a continuous target variable.Also Intel oneDAL(one Data Analytics) Library has been used in the project by using the command !pip install scikit-learn-intelex.

Business Model:
There are various factors that determine the price of a flight. More and more features or attributes and variables can be added in the model in the future to gain more useful insights.
An application can be created to enable hassle free planning of travel.
In order to scale, along with the booking of flight tickets different segments like booking of bus, train and other modes of travel can be added.
Also reservations that are directly or indirectly related with the modes of travel can be incorporated.
Thus making the application or in a sense the business ‘Everything Under One Roof‘.
